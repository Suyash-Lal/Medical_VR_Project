# Medical_VR_Project

## Overview

This repository contains the **CPR Simulation VR Project**, developed in Unity. The goal of this project is to create an immersive and interactive virtual reality experience that simulates the process of performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The simulation is designed to help users learn and practice CPR techniques in a realistic virtual environment.

## Features

- **Haptic Feedback**: Provides users with tactile feedback to simulate the pressure required during chest compressions.
- **Pressure Slider Visualization**: Displays real-time feedback on the pressure applied during compressions, helping users understand the correct force needed.
- **Heatmap Analysis**: Visualizes the effectiveness and accuracy of pressure application over time.
- **Interactive VR Environment**: Fully immersive environment created using Unity, allowing users to engage with the simulation naturally.

## Objectives

- To enhance learning and retention of proper CPR techniques.
- To provide a safe and controlled environment for practice.
- To leverage VR technology to simulate real-world scenarios with precision and interactivity.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Unity**: Core development platform for the VR simulation.
- **Meta Quest 3**: Used for testing and experiencing the VR application.
- **C#**: Scripting language used for implementing simulation logic and interactivity.
- **VR Interaction Toolkit**: To facilitate interaction within the virtual environment.

## Current Progress

- Development of the chest compression simulation with real-time pressure feedback is complete.
- Haptic feedback and heatmap visualization features are under testing for refinement.
- Ongoing improvements in the user interface and overall user experience.

## Future Scope

- Implementation of haptic feedback behavior using Arduino
- Integration of guided tutorials to teach the CPR process step-by-step.
- Implementation of a scoring system to evaluate user performance.
- Expansion to include other life-saving procedures in the simulation.
- Creation of an additional scene with the simulation of a kidney transplant procedure.
